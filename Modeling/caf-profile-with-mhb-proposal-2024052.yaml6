IMO it is important to create explicit and consistent ties to the core im wherever possible - so the relationship to this core model is as clear as possible. This is what will unify understanding of variant knowledge of different types across any profile).

The question then becomes how to do this to let us indicate what subset of properties from the core DataSet class are possible to use in this profile. Also, the StudyRestuls property to capture a soruce dataset is called `sourceDataSet` - which extends InformationEntity.derivedFrom.
