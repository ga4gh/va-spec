.. note:: This data class is at a **trial use** maturity level and may \
    change in future releases. Maturity \
    levels are described in the :ref:`maturity-model`.

**Computational Definition**

An abstract entity representing a possible fact that may be true or false. As abstract entities, Propositions capture a 'sharable' piece of meaning whose identify and existence is independent of space and time, or whether it is ever asserted to be true by some agent.

**Information Model**

Some Proposition attributes are inherited from :ref:`gks-core:Entity`.
