      - number
      - 0..1
      - A quantitative score that indicates the strength of a Proposition's assessment in the direction indicated (i.e. how strongly supported or disputed the Proposition is believed to be). Depending on its implementation, a score may reflect how *confident* that agent is that the Proposition is true or false, or the *strength of evidence* they believe supports or disputes it. Instructions for how to interpret the meaning of a given score may be gleaned from the method or document referenced in 'specifiedBy' attribute.

      - :ref:`MappableConcept`
      - 1..1
      - A single term or phrase classifying the subject variant based on the outcome of direction and strength assessments of the Statement's Proposition, using terms from the AMP/ASCO/CAP 2017 Guidelines.

      - :ref:`EvidenceLine` | :ref:`iriReference`
      - 0..m
      - An evidence-based argument that supports or disputes the validity of the proposition that a Statement assesses or puts forth as true. The strength and direction of this argument (whether it supports or disputes the proposition, and how strongly) is based on an interpretation of one or more pieces of information as evidence (i.e. 'Evidence Items).
