       *  - direction
          - string
          - 1..1
          - The direction of this Statement with respect to the predicate.
       *  - strength
          - `Coding <../../gks-common/common-source.json#/$defs/Coding>`_ | `IRI <../../gks-common/common-source.json#/$defs/IRI>`_

          - The overall strength of support for the Statement based on all evidence assessed.
       *  - statementText
          - string
          - 0..1
          - A natural-language expression of what a structured Statement object asserts to be true. e.g. for a Variant Pathogenicity statement, "BRCA2 c.8023A>G is pathogenic for Breast Cancer", or "there is moderate evidence supporting the pathogenicity of BRCA2 c.8023A>G for Breast Cancer".
       *  - classification
          - `Coding <../../gks-common/common-source.json#/$defs/Coding>`_ | `IRI <../../gks-common/common-source.json#/$defs/IRI>`_
          - 0..1
          - A single term or phrase summarizing the outcome of direction and strength assessments of a Statement, in terms of a classification of the Statement's subject. Permissible values for this attribute are typically selected to be succinct and familiar in the target community of practice. e.g. 'likely pathogenic' in the domain of variant pathogenicity classification'.
       *  - hasEvidenceOfType
          - `Coding <../../gks-common/common-source.json#/$defs/Coding>`_
          - 0..m
          - A term describing a type of evidence used to assess the validity of Statement (e.g. 'sequence similarity evidence', 'in vitro assay evidence').
       *  - hasEvidenceLines
          - `EvidenceLine <../core-im/core.json#/$defs/EvidenceLine>`_
          - 0..m
          - A discrete, independent argument relevant to the validity put forth in the Statement. This argument is based on the interpretation of one or more pieces of information as evidence.
       *  - hasEvidence
          - `InformationEntity <../core-im/core.json#/$defs/InformationEntity>`_
          - 0..m
          - A piece of information that represents or contributes to an argument for or against the validity of the Proposition put forth in a Statement. This is a shortcut relation that links a Statement directly to a piece of evidence supporting it, bypassing the Evidence Line class when used data creators do not utilize an Evidence Line object.
       *  - type
          - string
          - 1..1
          - MUST be "VariantPathogenicityStatement".
       *  - subjectVariant
          - `Variation <../../vrs/vrs.json#/$defs/Variation>`_ | `CategoricalVariation <../../cat-vrs/cat-vrs.json#/$defs/CategoricalVariation>`_ | `IRI <../../gks-common/common.json#/$defs/IRI>`_
          - 1..1
          - A variant that is the subject of the Statement.
       *  - predicate
          - string
          - 1..1
          - The predicate of the Statement.
       *  - objectCondition
          - `Condition <../../gks-domain-entities/domain-entities.json#/$defs/Condition>`_ | `IRI <../../gks-common/common.json#/$defs/IRI>`_
          - 1..1
          - The :ref:`Condition` for which the variant impact is stated.
       *  - penetranceQualifier
          - string
          - 0..1
          - Extends the statement to report the penetrance of the pathogenic effect - i.e. the extent to which the variant impact is expressed by individuals carrying it as a measure of the proportion of carriers exhibiting the condition.
       *  - modeOfInheritanceQualifier
          - string
          - 0..1
          - Reports a pattern of inheritance expected for the pathogenic effect of the variant.
       *  - geneContextQualifier
          - `Gene <../../gks-domain-entities/domain-entities.json#/$defs/Gene>`_
          - 0..1
          - Reports the gene through which the pathogenic effect asserted for the variant is mediated (i.e. it is the variant's impact on this gene that is responsible for causing the condition).
