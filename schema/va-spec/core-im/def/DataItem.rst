          - The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different system, or may refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).
       *  - label
          - string
          - 0..1
          - A primary name for the entity.

          - 0..m
          - A list of extensions to the entity. Extensions are not expected to be natively understood, but may be used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes between systems.
       *  - type
          - string
          - 1..1
          - Must be "DataItem"

          - 0..1
          - A :ref:`Method` that describes all or part of the process through which the information was generated.
       *  - contributions
          - `Contribution <../../gks-core-im/core.json#/$defs/Contribution>`_
          - 0..m
          - A list of :ref:`Contribution` objects that describe the activities performed by agents upon this entity.
       *  - isReportedIn

          - 0..m
          - A document in which the information content is expressed.
       *  - dateAuthored
          - string
          - 0..1
          - Indicates when the information content expressed in the Information Entity was generated.

          - `InformationEntity <../../gks-core-im/core.json#/$defs/InformationEntity>`_
          - 0..m
          - Another Information Entity from which this Information Entity is derived, in whole or in part.
       *  - recordMetadata
          - #/$defs/RecordMetadata
          - 0..1
          - Metadata that applies to a specific concrete record of information as encoded in a particular system.
       *  - subtype
          - `Coding <../../gks-core-im/core-im-source.yaml#/$defs/Coding>`_
          - 0..1
          - A specific type of data the DataItem object represents (e.g. a specimen count, a patient weight, an allele frequency, a p-value, a confidence score)
