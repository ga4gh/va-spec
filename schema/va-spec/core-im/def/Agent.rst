**Computational Definition**

An autonomous actor (person, organization, or computational agent) that bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent's activity.

    **Information Model**
    
Some Agent attributes are inherited from :ref:`gks.common:Entity`.

          - string
          - 0..1
          - The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different system, or may refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).
       *  - label
          - string
          - 0..1
          - A primary name for the entity.
       *  - description
          - string
          - 0..1
          - A free-text description of the entity.
       *  - mappings

          - 0..m
          - A list of mappings to concepts in terminologies or code systems. Each mapping should include a coding and a relation.
       *  - extensions
          - `Extension <../../gks-common/common.json#/$defs/Extension>`_
          - 0..m
          - A list of extensions to the entity. Extensions are not expected to be natively understood, but may be used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes between systems.
       *  - type
          - string
          - 0..1
          - MUST be "Agent".
       *  - name
          - string
          - 0..1
          - The descriptive name of the agent.
       *  - subtype
          - string
          - 0..1
          - A more specific type of agent the agent represents.
