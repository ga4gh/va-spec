      statementText:
        type: string
        description: >-
          A natural-language expression of what a structured Statement object asserts to be true.
          e.g. for a Variant Pathogenicity statement, "BRCA2 c.8023A>G is pathogenic for Breast
          Cancer", or "there is moderate evidence supporting the pathogenicity of BRCA2 c.8023A>G

      proposition:
        $ref: "#/$defs/Proposition"
        description:  >-
          A possible fact that the Statement assesses or puts forth as true. This attribute provides
          the option of encapsulating the structured semantics of the possible fact asserted or
          evaluated by a Statement in a separate 'Proposition' object - instead of using the subject,
          predicate, object, qualifier properties directly in the Statement object.

        description: >-
          A single term or phrase summarizing the outcome of direction and strength
          assessments of a Statement's proposition, in terms of a classification of the
          Statement subject. Permissible values for this attribute are typically
          selected to be succinct and familiar in the target community of practice. e.g.
          'likely pathogenic' in the domain of variant pathogenicity classification'.

        description: >-
          A term describing a type of evidence used to assess the validity of Statement's proposition

        description: >-
          A piece of information that represents or contributes to an argument for or against the
          validity of the Proposition put forth in a Statement. This is a shortcut relation that links
          a Statement directly to a piece of evidence supporting it, bypassing the Evidence Line class
          when used data creators do not utilize an Evidence Line object.

  StudyResult:
    inherits: gks.core:InformationEntity
    maturity: draft
    description: >-
      A collection of data items from a single study that are about a particular subject or experimental
      unit in the study, along with optional provenance information describing how these data items were
      generated. StudyResult objects provide a flexible and useful way to summarize a subset of data items
      from a larger study that are cited as evidence in curation workflows that generate higher order
      knowledge about a particular variant or other entity.
    heritableProperties:
      focus:
        $refCurie: gks.core:DomainEntity
        description: >-
          The specific subject or experimental unit in a Study that data in the StudyResult object is about.
          e.g. a particular variant in a population allele frequency dataset like ExAC or gnomAD.

        type: object
        additionalProperties: false
        description: >-
          An item of data that is included in the StudyResult because it pertains to the 'focus' of the result.
          This data can directly describe this 'focus' (e.g. the population frequency of an allele focus), or 
          represent metadata about how data about the 'focus' were generated (e.g the sequencing method used to 
          determine this allele frequency).
        comment: >-
          Note that in profiles of the StudyResult class, 'dataItem' is typically specialized into one or more 
          datatype-specific properties that are defined to capture a specifc kind of data. e.g. 'focusAlleleCount'
          and 'focusAlleleFrequency' in a CohortAlleleFrequencyStudyResult profile.

        description: >-
          A Study Result comprised of data items about the same focus as its parent Result, but based on a

      as evidence (i.e. Evidence Items).

        description: >-
          The possible fact against which evidence items contained in an Evidence Line were collectively evaluated,
          in determining the overall strength and direction of support they provide. e.g. in an ACMG Guideline-based
          assessment of variant pathogenicity, the support provided by distinct lines of evidence are assessed against
          a target proposition that a variant is pathogenic for a specific disease.

        type: array
        ordered: false
        items:
          $refCurie: gks.core:InformationEntity
        description: >-

  Proposition:
    inherits: gks.core:Entity
    maturity: draft
    type: object
    description: >-
      The abstract entity representing a possible fact that may be put forth as true, or subjected to
      an evidence-based assessment, by a Statement. As abstract entities, their identity and existence
      are independent of space and time, and whether they are ever asserted to be true by some agent.
      Propositions may be used in two contexts; (1) by Statements that assert them to be true or false,
      or describe the overall level of confidence/evidence for or against them; (2) by Evidence Lines that
      report the direction and strength of an evidence-based argument for the Proposition.
