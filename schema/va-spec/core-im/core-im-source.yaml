      The abstract entity representing a possible fact that may be put forth as true, or subjected to

      are independent of space and time, and whether they are ever asserted to be true by some agent.
      Propositions may be used in two contexts; (1) by Statements that assert them to be true or false,
      or describe the overall level of confidence/evidence for or against them; (2) by Evidence Lines that
      report the direction and strength of an evidence-based argument for the Proposition.
