    comment: >-
      Record-level metadata applies to a specific concrete encoding/serialization of information 
      (e.g as a record in a specific data/knowlegebase, or an online digital resource). 
      A RecordMetadata object can capture when, how, and by whom a specific record serialization was
      generated or modified; what upstream resources it was derived or retrieved from; and record-level 
      administrative information such as versioning and lifecycle status. RecordMetadata objects should 
      not be used to describe provenance of the abstract information content or knowledge captured in a 
      data record or object - other properties in the model are defined to support this use case.
