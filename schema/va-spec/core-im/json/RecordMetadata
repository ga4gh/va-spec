   "comment": "Record-level metadata applies to a specific concrete encoding/serialization of information (e.g as a record in a specific data/knowlegebase, or an online digital resource). A RecordMetadata object can capture when, how, and by whom a specific record serialization was generated or modified; what upstream resources it was derived or retrieved from; and record-level administrative information such as versioning and lifecycle status. RecordMetadata objects should not be used to describe provenance of the abstract information content or knowledge captured in a data record or object - other properties in the model are defined to support this use case.",
