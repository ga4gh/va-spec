          Extends the statement to report the penetrance of the pathogenic effect - i.e. the extent
          to which the variant impact is expressed by individuals carrying it as a measure of the
          proportion of carriers exhibiting the condition.

          Reports a pattern of inheritance expected for the pathogenic effect of the variant.

          Reports the gene through which the pathogenic effect asserted for the variant is mediated
          (i.e. it is the variant's impact on this gene that is responsible for causing the condition).
