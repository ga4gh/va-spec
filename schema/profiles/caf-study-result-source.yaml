          The number of occurrences of all alleles at the locus in the cohort

        description: >-
          A list of CohortAlleleFrequency objects describing subcohorts of the cohort currently being described.
          This creates a recursive relationship and subcohorts can be further subdivided into more subcohorts.
          This enables, for example, the description of different ancestry groups and sexes among those ancestry groups.
