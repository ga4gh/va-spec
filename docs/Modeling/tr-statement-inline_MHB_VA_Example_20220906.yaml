# A VA-aligned representation of Alex's latest civic tr evidence example here: https://github.com/ga4gh/va-spec/blob/metakb-cvc/tests/fixtures/tr-statement-inline.yaml  (as of 9-6-22)
# It represents EID879 as a VA EvidenceLine, and is based on the assumption that primary statement made by this EID record is that 
# "The Sequist et al. 2013 study results provide Level B evidence that supports the proposition that 'EGFR L858R predicts sensitivity to Afatinib in NSCLC'".
# The Evidence Line class in the VA Model is specifically suited to represent these kinds of statements.
# All changes from Alex's latest example are marked with an explanatory comment.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# A VA aligned representation of this EID record as a VA PropositionAssessmentStatement (which I thnk is Alex' initial intent?).
# This representation imparts the following, subtly different semantics onto the primary statement made by this EID record: 
# "The proposition that 'EGFR L858R # predicts sensitivity to Afatinib in NSCLC' is supported by  Sequist et al. 2013 study results with 
# evidence Level B".

# Note that the only difference from the EvidenceLine representation is the 'type' of the root object (hence the rest of the example is not shown). 
# But this is an important difference when considering how this EID will look alongside AID6, and other CIVIC assertion records 
# it may support. Typing EID records as EvidenceLines makes a very important distinction very clear - namely that this record describes only the 
# strength and direction and support of evidence as provided by a single, particular line of support - and should not be interpreted as indicative 
# of the overall strentgh/direction of support that exists for the target Proposition. 
# Without this type difference, I see nothing to make this clear - but I cannot say for sure as I have not seen an example of how AIDs will be represented.

# This type level difference also allows us to define different enumeration bindings to attributes like evidence_level - where we need 
# different sets of terms as permissible values when talking about assessment of 'overall evidence' for a Proposition, vs assessment of 
# a single line of support for the Proposition.

# MHB comments on Alex's latest civic tr example here: https://github.com/ga4gh/va-spec/blob/metakb-cvc/tests/fixtures/tr-statement-inline.yaml  (as of 9-6-22)
# (I reordered the Statement attributes to group related things together, and present a clearer narrtive of the Statement.

id: civic.eid:879
type: VariationTherapeuticResponseStatement                   # Note the name of the Statement type here is different than that of the Proposition type. Also, I would type EIDs as Evidence Lines. But I would first like to see how this compares to an AID record, and how these levels of statements will be set apart.

## MHB: IMO this is a description of the evidence (the study result), not the actual/ultiamte Statement that is being made here by the EID879 record.
## And this confusion IMO betrays a fundamental and critical disconnect between how VA and the current metakb-cvc model are understanding and representing EID statements.
