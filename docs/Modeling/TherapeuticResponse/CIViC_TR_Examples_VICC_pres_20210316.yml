# CIVIC Assertion6 (AID6) record, along with one of its six Evidence Lines
# See  https://civicdb.org/events/assertions/6/summary (website record), https://civicdb.org/api/assertions/6 (API payload)

# This example does not use Propositions for 'asserted proposition' semantics, but does demonstrate their use for explicitly representing the "target proposition" of an EID / Evidence Line.  Propositions are being explored in this was as a means to formally link the products of Evidence curation and Assertion activities - through their shared Proposition.
