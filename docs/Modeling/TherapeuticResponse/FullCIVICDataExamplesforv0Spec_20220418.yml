# Appendix I: The real EID879
# I simplified the example above by making the target proposition of the evidence line the same as that of the root Statement (which is the case 99% of the time).
# But the actual target proposition in EID879 is different than the root Statement's asserted proposition (differing only in that the disease object is a subtype of the disease object in the root TE Statement)
# Below is a representation of the true EID879:

# Appendix II: a more concise representation of StudyREsult Data Items
# An implementation could choose to define named fields for each type of data in their specialization of the VA Study Result class, rather than using the more verbose and nested generic structures provided by the Core IM.
# This might look something like the following for civic-data:StudyResult001:
   studyResultType: ClinicalTrialResult
   study_size: 308         
   median_PFS_drug: 13.6 months
   median_PFS_comparator: 6.9 months
   hazard_ratio: 0.47; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.65
   p-value: 0.001
