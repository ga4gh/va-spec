# CIVIC Assertion6 (AID6) record, along with one of its six Evidence Lines
# See  https://civicdb.org/events/assertions/6/summary (website record), https://civicdb.org/api/assertions/6 (API payload)

# This VA data example is rooted at a 'domain level statement' / 'generalized knowledge assertion' - but we are experimenting with making this an 'Evidence Level Assertion'.
# It does not use Propositions for 'asserted proposition' semantics, but does demonstrate their use for explicitly representing the "target proposition" of an EID / Evidence Line.  
# Propositions at the root Assertion-level are being explored in parallel efforts as a means to formally link the products of Evidence Curation and Assertion activities - through their shared / related Propositions.  
# Note that the prefixes "civic-data" and civic-term" reflect made-up namespaces for native CIViC identifiers.
# Note also that a few of the data values below are added by me to ilustrate how the VA model could accommodate additioanl, useful information (e.g. the CIViC SOP method).
