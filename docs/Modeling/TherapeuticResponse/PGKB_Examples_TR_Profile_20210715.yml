    text: Genotype TT is associated with decreased response to adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab in people with Arthritis, Rheumatoid as compared to genotypes CC + CT.  
    description: "Patients with the TT genotype had poorer response to the anti-TNFalpha drugs after 3 months of treatment. Response to therapy was assessed according to EULAR response criteria. Please note alleles have been complemented to the plus chromosomal strand."

# We don't NEED an evidence line - as the data PGKB makes available doesn't include assessment of direction or strength of evidnece provided by each supporting study finding at the var_ann level.  But evidence is curated and scored at a more detailed level than PGKB reports publically - and it may be possible to use this finer grained evidence scoring information to generate evidence strength metric here. Including an Evidence Line here as a placeholder for such a metric (as it doesn't hurt anything). If we dropped it, use has_evidence to link directly from the TE Statement to the supporting Study Result
