# Source data: https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/1-55505485-G-A
# Note that I condensed the data a bit by making all Codings into simple enums
# Illustrates two types of Study Result objects: 
   # 1. Popmax Allele Filtering Frequency Study Reuslts: holds the calculated Popmax Filtering AF for the variant, along with some provenance metadata
   # 2. Population Allele Frequency Study Result: holds more foundational allele count and frequency data for specified populations/subpopulations in the gnomAD dataset


## Approach 1: Features
    ## Separate, stand-alone StudyResult objects for each discrete population in which we want to describe variation data.
    ## Does not define formal subclasses for each result type - rather, uses the Core IM StudyResult class as is and moves domain specific semantics into subtype fields. Specifically:
    #### - indicates result type in the StudyResult.subtype field
    #### - captures data items comprising a Result in DataItem objects where the type of the data is indicated in the 'subtype' field ((e.g subtype: allele count)
    ## Uses string enums rather than Codings for all coded values for now (to keep example as concise as possible - may decide to use Codings for some/all of these)
