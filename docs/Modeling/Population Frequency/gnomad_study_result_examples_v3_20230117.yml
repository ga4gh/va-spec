# GKS-based Representation of gnomAD Population Allele Frequency Data
# Allele record used in data examples: https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/1-55505485-G-A
# VA-SEPIO based proposals leverage the VA-SEPIO 'StudyResult' Class.
# This class gets specialized to create two subclasses for representing different types of gnomAD data about a particular variant:
   # I.  PopmaxFilteringAlleleFrequencyStudyReuslt: holds the calculated Popmax Filtering AF for the variant, along with some metadata/provenance info
   # II. PopulationAlleleFrequencyStudyResult: holds more foundational allele count and frequency data for specified populations/subpopulations in the gnomAD dataset

# The approach proposed here exhibits the following features:
    ## The model defines formal subclasses for each result type (e.g. "PopulationAlleleFrequencyStudyResult") - which permits us add new attrbutes to the class. 
    ## The model defines dedicated named attributes for each type of data item that can be captued in a given subclass (e.g. PopulationAlleleFrequencyStudyResult.alleleCount)
    ## Defines string enums rather than Codings to capture all coded values for now (to keep example as concise as possible - may decide to use Codings for some/all of these).
    ## In the data, we create separate, stand-alone StudyResult objects for each discrete population in which we want to describe data for a given variation.

## Question:  Heidi mentioned (at 16:45) that the Allele Number and depth of coverage are important data to assess the validity of a popmax filtering AF score . . . should we provide this info in the Study Result? At least the AN (Alex thought this was maybe sufficent)

## NOTE: Another way we might capture populations on which the popmax calculation were based is in the definition of the StudyPopulation itself (instead of in data items), e.g: 
  studyPopulation: 
    id: cg-data:pop009
    type: StudyPopulation
    label: gnomad global
    characteristics:
      - name: ancestry
        description: genetic ancestry of the individual, as defined here: https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/help/ancestry
        value:
          - AFR

## . . . this could work if the Popmax AF calcualtion is simply based on information about the 'basis' population (in which allele freq is highest)
