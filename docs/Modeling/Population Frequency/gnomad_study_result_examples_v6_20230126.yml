# GKS-based Representation of gnomAD Population Allele Frequency Data
# Allele record used in data examples: https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/1-55505485-G-A

# VA-SEPIO based proposals leverage the 'StudyResult' Class.
# This class gets specialized to create a domain-specific 'PopulationAlleleFrequencyStudyResult' subclass, for which we define dedicated named attributes for each type of data item that can be captured (e.g. PopulationAlleleFrequencyStudyResult.alleleFrequency)
# The data item-specific attributes defined for this one subclass will support two different use cases:
   # I.  Reepresenting the calculated Popmax Filtering AF for the variant (along with some metadata/provenance info)
   # II. Representing more true allele count and frequency data for the variant in specific populations/subpopulations (along with metadata/provenance info)

# Data providers will create separate, stand-alone StudyResult objects for each discrete population in which they want to describe a particular type of frequency data for a given variation (popmax vs true frequency).
# External conventions/constraints for how to apply this single subtype to support different types of frequency information are not needed - because the schema is constructed so that it fully specifies/constrains how to create the data

# Four scenarios are illustrated below:
## Scenario 1. A StudyResult showing the 95% CI filtering AF score for the 1-55505485-G-A allele, based on exome data from the global gnomAD v2.1.1 dataset (i.e. all ancestries, 141,456 samples)
## Scenario 2. A StudyResult showing the **99% CI** filtering AF score, based on exome data from the gnomAD v2.1.1 dataset 
## Scenario 3. A StudyResult showing the *true* allele frequency for the 1-55505485-G-A allele, based on exome and genome data from subjects of any ancestry in the 'non-cancer' subset of gnomAD 2.1.1  
## Scenario 4. A StudyResult showing the *true* allele frequency for the 1-55505485-G-A allele, based on exome data from NFE female subjects in the *control* subset of gnomAD v2.1.1 data
