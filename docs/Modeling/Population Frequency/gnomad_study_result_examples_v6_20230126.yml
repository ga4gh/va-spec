# GKS-based Representation of gnomAD Population Allele Frequency Data
# Allele record used in data examples: https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/1-55505485-G-A

# VA-SEPIO based proposals leverage the VA-SEPIO 'StudyResult' Class.
# This class gets specialized to create a domain-specific 'PopulationAlleleFrequencyStudyResult' subclass, for which we define dedicated named attributes for each type of data item that can be captured (e.g. PopulationAlleleFrequencyStudyResult.alleleFrequency)
# The data item-specific attributes defined for this subclass will support two different use cases:
   # I.  Reepresenting the calculated Popmax Filtering AF for the variant (along with some metadata/provenance info)
   # II. Representing more foundational allele count and frequency data for the variant in specific populations/subpopulations (along with metadata/provenance info)

# Data providers will create separate, stand-alone StudyResult objects for each discrete population in which we want to describe a particular type of frequency data (popmax vs straight frequency), for a given variation.
# External guidance/conventions will provide additional instruction for how to apply this single subtype to support these different types of frequency information (e.g. what attributes are required for the popmax use case vs the foundational frequency use case) 

# Four scenarios are illustrated below:
## Scenario 1. A StudyResult showing the 95% CI filtering AF score for the 1-55505485-G-A allele, based on exome data from the global gnomAD v2.1.1 dataset (i.e. all ancestries, 141,456 samples)
## Scenario 2. A StudyResult showing the **99% CI** filtering AF score, based on exome data from the gnomAD v2.1.1 dataset 
## Scenario 3. A StudyResult showing the *true* allele frequency for the 1-55505485-G-A allele, based on exome and genome data from subjects of any ancestry in the 'non-cancer' subset of gnomAD 2.1.1  
## Scenario 4. A StudyResult showing the *true* allele frequency for the 1-55505485-G-A allele, based on exome data from NFE females in the *control* subset of gnomAD v2.1.1 data (all ancestries, 60,146  samples)
