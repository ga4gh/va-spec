# GKS-based Representation of gnomAD Population Allele Frequency Data
# Allele record used in data examples: https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/1-55505485-G-A

# VA-SEPIO based proposals leverage the VA-SEPIO 'StudyResult' Class.
# This class gets specialized to create a domain-specific 'PopulationAlleleFrequencyStudyResult' subclass, for which we define dedicated named attributes for each type of data item that can be captured (e.g. PopulationAlleleFrequencyStudyResult.alleleFrequency)
# The data item-specific attributes defined for this subclass will support two different use cases:
   # I.  Reepresenting the calculated Popmax Filtering AF for the variant (along with some metadata/provenance info)
   # II. Representing more foundational allele count and frequency data for the variant in specific populations/subpopulations (along with metadata/provenance info)

# Data providers will create separate, stand-alone StudyResult objects for each discrete population in which we want to describe a particular type of frequency data (popmax vs straight frequency), for a given variation.
# External guidance/conventions will provide additional instruction for how to apply this single subtype to support these different types of frequency information (e.g. what attributes are required for the popmax use case vs the foundational frequency use case)
