# GKS-based Representation of gnomAD Population Allele Frequency Data
# Allele record used in data examples: https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/1-55505485-G-A

# VA-SEPIO based proposals leverage the VA-SEPIO 'StudyResult' Class.
# This class gets specialized to create a domain-specific 'PopulationAlleleFrequencyStudyResult' subclass, for which we define dedicated named attributes for each type of data item that can be captured (e.g. PopulationAlleleFrequencyStudyResult.alleleFrequency)
# The data item-specific attributes defined for this subclass will support two different use cases:
   # I.  Reepresenting the calculated Popmax Filtering AF for the variant (along with some metadata/provenance info)
   # II. Representing more foundational allele count and frequency data for specified populations/subpopulations in the gnomAD dataset (along with metadata/provenance info)

# External guidance/conventions will describe how to apply this single subtype to support these different types of frequency information (e.g. what attributes are required for the popmax use case vs the foundational frequency use case) 
# Data providers will create separate, stand-alone StudyResult objects for each discrete population in which we want to describe a particular type of frequency data for a given variation.
# Finally, note that in the examples coded values are represented using simple string enums to keep things as concise as possible - but we may ultimately decide to use Codings for some/all of these.
