SCV3
VA/SEPIO Mock up for ClinVar SCV

Namespaces (per Identifiers.org)
    clinvar.submission         - SCV accessions
    clinvar                    - clinvar variation ids.
    clinvar.record             - RCV accessions
    clinvar.archive            - VCV accessions

Tasks/Todos.
    - find examples of SCVs that don't map well to VRS Allele/Haplotype... Can we normalize all these to a "text" form ?
    - reach out to ClinVar for VCV prefix in identifiers.org... (done - waiting on reply)
    - review/compare the externalMetaData object with the vrsDescriptor to see if these are translatable...
    - Terry or Tristan to verify that we use direct references on conditions in lieu of GeneticConditions when possible.
    - bring a new SCV example to the call with multiple case level data observations....
    - MB idea - use caseStudy VA object to group clinvar case level info. this should provide solution for multi-record case info per SCV.

I would suspect it might mint its own logical identifier, since the ClinGen Statement is distinct from the ClinVar record it is derived from. The ClinVar record identifier could be captured as a buisiness identifier (see FHIR defs/approach to using logical 'id' vs a business 'identifier').  If not, will the fully qualified/expanded id at least be unique to the ClinGen dataset / namespace?  A: most likely ClinGen will assign a unique internal logical id, different from the CV id.

      "The c.173C>T (p.Thr58Ile) variant in HRAS has been reported in the literature as an unconfirmed de novo occurrence in a patient with clinical features of a RASopathy (PM6; PMID 20112233, 16474405). Also, at least 2 independent occurrences of this variant have been detected in patients with a RASopathy (PS4_Supporting; PMID: 22488832, 18247425, 23321623, 20949621, 16921267). This variant was absent from large population studies (PM2; ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org). The p.Thr58Ile variant in HRAS is analogous to the same previously established amino acid change in the KRAS gene and the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel has defined that the pathogenicities of analogous variants in the HRAS and KRAS genes are correlated based on the assumption that a known functional residue in one gene is equivalent to other functions within that subgroup (PS1; 29493581). Furthermore, the variant is in a location that has been defined by the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel to be a mutational hotspot or domain of HRAS (PM1; PMID 29493581). The variant is in HRAS, which has been defined by the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel as a gene with low rate of benign missense with missense variants commonly being pathogenic (PP2; PMID 29493581). Computational prediction tools and conservation analysis suggest that the p.Thr58Ile variant may impact the protein (PP3). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for RASopathies in an autosomal dominant manner. Rasopathy-specific ACMG/AMP criteria applied (PMID:29493581): PM6, PS4_Supporting, PM2, PS1, PM1, PP2, PP3.",

    // Key data concerning Contributions (to three record-level artifacts - ClinGen's record, ClinVar's original record, and ClinVar's latest record) :
       - DateLastEvaluated="2017-04-03" - the submitting org's contribution to the knowledge expressed in the Statement
       - SubmissionDate="2019-02-25" - the submitting org's contribution to submitting the *latest* ClinVar SCV record 
       - DateCreated="2017-12-15" - ClinVar's contribution to creation of the *original v1* ClinVar SCV record 
       - DateLastUpdated="2019-07-17" - ClinVar's contribution to updating the *latest* ClinVar SCV record
       - *Date ClinGen Record Created="2020-09-27" - ClinGen's contribution to creating the ClinGen record of this Statement (this date is not in the ClinVar data, because this is about creation of the ClinGen record downstream of ClinVar)

      
## This  ClinGen-ClinVar use case is unique because it describes contributions to the ClinGen Statement at three 'levels': 
    (1) a 'knowledge-level' contribution by the submitter to the asserted fact expressed in the Statement (DateLastEvaluated, 2017-04-03); 
    (2) three contributions to 'upstream' ClinVar record-level artifacts from which the ClinGen Statement was derived
         - one made by the submitter to the current ClinVarSCV record (DateSubmitted, 2019-02-25)
         - one made by ClinVar to the original v1 ClinVar SCV record (DateCreated, 2017-12-15)
         - one made by ClinVar to the current ClinVar SCV record (DateLastUpdated, 2019-07-17)
    (3) one contribution to the ClinGen record carried in the current message - which was derived from the ClinVar records above. (DateGenerated, 2020-09-27).
        
## This use case to capture requirements to upstream records unique, and SEPIO/VA is exploring ways to support this (the present Record Metadata object is meant to capture record-level metadata for the record in the message itself, not upstream records from which it was derived). 

## Below we propose two ways the SEPIO/VA model might accommodate this
    - one that uses a single RecordMetadta object to hold all four record-level contributions (where the record that is being 'contributed to' is bundled into the semantics of the 'contributorRole')
    - another that allows for multiple RecordMetadata objects (one for each record to which contributions are described) - so more explicitly capture what the contributions being described are being made to, and offering more flexibility to capture other record metadata about upstream/source records from which a given record was derived. 

## Finally, before reviewing the examples below, make sure you have a thorough understanding of the difference between  "knowledge-level" and "record-level" provenance (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/11HuUMw3u9uf1RPa3FbFgSgbY47hDxAFWywbCYVxUMLI/edit#heading=h.51ekqk3uriqu)

   // Modeling Approach 1 - uses a single RecordMetadta object to hold all four record-level contributions, indicates the record being 'contributed to' in the semantics of the 'contributorRole'). AFTER A VERY PRELIMINARY OVERVIEW ON 11-24 CALL, WE ARE LEANING AWAY FROM THIS AND TOWARD APPROACH 2 BELOW.
