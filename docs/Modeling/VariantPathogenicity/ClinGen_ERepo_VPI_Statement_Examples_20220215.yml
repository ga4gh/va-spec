# ONE-PREDICATE, 'EVIDENCE LEVEL STATEMENT' REPRESENTATIONS OF CLINGEN EREPO VARIANT CLASSIFICATIONS.
# This file contains example SEPIO-VA based representations of variant pathogenicity classifications from the ClinGen ERepo, 
# We demonstrate different classification outcomes (P, LP, B, LB, VUS, and VUS-TLP), using a  1-predicate 'Evidence Level Statement' paradigm, with Propostions.
# These examples focus only on representing the semantics of the assertion, and the level of evidence/confidence supporting it.
# Evidence supporting the assertion is not shown - and will be the focus of subsequence modeling work.
# A separate file that applies a 3-predicate 'Domain Statement' approach to represent the same examples can be found here:  

# Domain Statement vs 'Evidence Level Statement' Paradigms:
### In a 'Domain Statement' approach/paradigm, the Proposition's job is to encapsulate what the curator is asserting to be true. 
### This is why the field pointing to it is called 'asserted_proposition'.
### The Statement.evidence_strength field indicates the curator's assessment of the overall strength of  ALL evidence they evaluated. THe Statement.evidence_direction field is not applicable here.
### By contrast, in the 'Evidence Level Statement' approach/paradigm, the Proposition's role is to represent the 'possible fact' toward which the curator is assessing evidence. 
### This is why the field pointing to it is called 'target_proposition'.  The claim it presents may not be determined to be true.
### As in the Domain Statement paradigm, the Statement.evidence_strength field here indicates the curator's assessment of the overall strength of  ALL evidence they evaluated.
### In addition, the Statement.evidence_direction field indicates if the net direction of this evidence supports or refutes the target Proposition.
