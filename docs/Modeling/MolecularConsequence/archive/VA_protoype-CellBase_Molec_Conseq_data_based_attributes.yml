# v3 of a prototype model of the GeL/CellBase Molecular Consequence annotation at http://bioinfo.hpc.cam.ac.uk/cellbase/webservices/rest/v4/hsapiens/genomic/variant/19:45411941:T:C/annotation?include=consequenceType.
# This prototype creates a more structured message by identifying supporting/secondary statements in the CellBase record and wrapping them in with their 'parent' molecular consequence annotation.  
# This particular example offers a data based view on the attributes
