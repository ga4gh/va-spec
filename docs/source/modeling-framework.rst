Modeling Framework
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Modes of Use
############

The VA-Spec will support different levels of adoption and use - from direct contribution to model development and testing, to out-of-the-box adoption of final VA standards.
 * **Mode 1: Direct Adoption**: users want to use an existing VA model as is.
    * Use Case 
       * adopeters have an existing resource that provides variant knowledge, represented using an established model
       * adopters want to transform their data into VA-compliant form as best that existing VA models allow . . . not interested in developing or extending a profile
       * adopters donâ€™t want to use VA model internally, or need VA model to support every last piece of data in their system. 

    * Guidenace:
       * review documentation of existing VA Standard Profiles `HERE <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standard-profiles/index.html>`_.
       * access formal json schema specifications of selected models `HERE <https://github.com/ga4gh/va-spec/tree/1.x/schema/profiles/json>`_.

* **Mode 2: Modified Adoption**: users want to take standard and adapt for use in internal systems


* **Mode 3: De novo Profiling**: uers want to define profiles from scratch - for new statement types perhaps . . .
