The end product of the **VA-Spec Modeling Framework** is a set of **Standard Profiles** that provide the GA4GH community with shared schema for describing specific kinds of **Statements** and **Study Results** about genetic variation. Implementation of these schema in working systems allows for the **production and exchange of interoperable data**, reporting **diverse kinds of variation knowledge**. 

Here we provide a diverse set of **annotated examples of VA-Spec data**, to illustrate the **modeling patterns and principles** employed across Standard Profiles to represent variation knowledge. 

**Examples:**
