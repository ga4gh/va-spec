Overview
########

Reliable exchange of knowledge about molecular variation between clinicians, researchers, and testing laboratories is required to maximize the personal, public, research, and clinical value of genomic information. This knowledge is typically exchanged as **Variant Annotations** - structured data objects that holds a **central statement of knowledge** about a **molecular variation**, along with **evidence and provenance metadata** supporting its interpretation and use (see `"What is a Variant Annotation?" <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-is-a-variant-annotation>`_). 

The **GA4GH Variant Annotation Specification (VA-Spec)** was developed by a partnership among national information resource providers and major public initiatives â€” as an open specification to standardize the exchange of such variation knowledge. It was built as a SEPIO-based modeling framework that supports implementation-driven development of standard models for specific VA Statement types (see `"What is SEPIO?" <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-is-the-sepio-framework>`_). It leverages the **GA4GH `VRS <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ and `Cat-VRS <https://github.com/ga4gh/cat-vrs?tab=readme-ov-file>`_ specifications** to represent diverse kinds of molecular variation as annotation subjects (see `"What types of variants are supported?" <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-types-of-variants-are-supported>`_). And it supports diverse kinds of biological and clinical variant knolwedge, leaving case-level variant information to other standards (see `"What types of variant knowledge are supported?" <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-kinds-of-variant-knowledge-are-supported>`_). 

The VA-Spec Modeling framework is comprised of the following components:

#. `A Foundational 'GKS Core Information Model' <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core-information-model/index.html>`_: A domain-agnostic model for describing knowledge statements of any kind, and the evidence and provenance supporting them. This model, which is based on the SEPIO Core-IM, establishes a shared understanding of fundamental terms, concepts, and modeling patterns - and provides a foundation on which standard models for specific types of statements about molecular variation are built.  

#. `Standard VA Profiles <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standard-profiles/index.html>`_: A set of models built as 'Profiles' of the Statement or Study Result classes in the Core Information Model, to support specific types of knolwedge about molecular variation (e.g. a `Variant Pathogenicity Statement <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standard-profiles/statement-profiles.html#variant-pathogenicity-statement>`_) profile. These models are provided in machine-readable json schema, as shared standards for validation and exchange of data by the GA4GH community. 

#. `A Profiling Methodology <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modeling-framework.html>`_:  A formal method and tooling support to guide internal and external developers in executing the profiling process. This approach allows community adopters to  build profiles for new statement types, or extend existing profiles - supporting an implementation-led approach that drives VA standards development.

#. `A Python Reference Implementation <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference-implementation.html>`_:  Code libraries that demonstrate the creation, validation, and exchange of compliant data using GA4GH Profiles. These resources provide a working example of code that can be adopted and/or extended by adopters. ``COMING SOON``

This framework has allowed for implementation-driven development that reduces bottlenecks imposed by centralized approaches, leverages the expertise of diverse adopters, and delivers schema that have proven out in working applications.

VA Standards Development and Adoption
#####################################
The series of figures below provides a high-level overview of the **implementation-driven processes through which VA Profiles are created and matured into standards**. A **Variant Pathogenicity Statement** profile is used as an example, but the process described applied generally to any Standard Profile development task.


** GKS Core-IM extracted from the SEPIO Information Model*

The initial version of the GKS Core-IM represents a subset of SEPIO model, with elements selected based on the needs of early adopter VA-Spec implementations, including a ClinGen/VICC Variant Pathogenicity Statement Profile to support ClinVar data. As these inital profiles expand to support more data, or profiles for new statement types are developed, additional elements can be pulled into the GKS Core-IM form the SEPIO model to support them. 


.. image:: images/va-profiling-step1.png
  :width: 1000

**Draft Implementation Profiles Specialize the GKS Core-IM**
Elements form the GKS Core-IM are selected for includsion and then specialized with statement and application-specific constraints - based on the needs of active implementations. In this case, classes and attributes are sleected and specialized to represent ClinVar Variant Pathogenicity statements. These **Draft Implementation Profiles** stick to the Core-IM model where possible, but may add new features where this model does not support source data or requirements. 

**Align and Refine Models**
Draft implementation models may include features that are not consistent with or included in the foundational GKS and SEPIO Core Models. Implementers work with the VA Team to identify such cases, and refine models to bring them into alignment. This may involve refining the draft implementation model to use GKS or SEPIO modeling patterns, or adding new features to these standard models to support new requirements surfaced by the implementation. This process requries negotioan across developers of SEPIO, VA, and Implementation models. Any implementation-specific features not ultimately supported by the GKS Core-IM can be captured in a compliant way by using the `Extension <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core-information-model/data-types.html#extension>`_ element.


**Publish as a GA4GH Standard Profile**
Once all models are aligned, the draft is circulated for community review.  After concernes and feedback are addressed, it is published as an official VA Standard Profile for the Statement type. 


**Evolve Profile to Support New Requirements**
Standard Profiles will evolve as existing implementations expand coverage of the initial draft, or additional implementations provide new requirements to cover their knowledge sources. e.g. the Variant Pathogeniity Profile will evolve as ClinGen expands the ClinVar data it needs the profile to cover, and other Driver Projects such AGHA/Shariant adopt the standard and need it to support their implementations. 



The activities described above unfold across a stack of interdependent models and specifications. The `Quick Start Guide <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start.html>`_ provides a more detailed overview of this ecosystem, and how to engage with it. And this `Profiling Methodology overview <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/profiling-methodology.html>`_  explains specific tasks and conventions involved in buidling VA Profiles. Finally, See the `Modeling Foundations document <>`_ to understand model general patterns and principles employed by the VA Standards, and the `Core Information Model <>`_ index of Class definitions for a deep dive into the data supported by each.

.. note::  **Statement vs Study Result Profiles**: While the majority of applications of the VA-Spec deal in knowledge statements, and use **Statement** Profiles, the modeling framework supports        profiling of other Core-IM classes such as **Study Result**. This is done when the information captured represents data items a study or dataset pertaining to some variant of interest, as           opposed to a broader statement of knowledge (e.g, one that may be concluded from interpretation of such data). For example, the `CohortAlleleFrequencyStudyResult <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standard-profiles/study-result-profiles.html#cohort-allele-frequency-study-result>`_ profile specializes the StudyResult class to represent select data from statistical analyses of allele frequencies in different human populations along with methodological and quality metadata. More information on these types of profiles can be found `here <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modeling-framework.html#profiling-methodology>`_.



Implementing the VA-Spec
########################

The VA Modeling Framework offers many modes for engaging with the VA-Specification. Some users will want to adopt established standard profiles out-of-the-box, others may want to extend or refine an existing standard profile for their use case, while others may want to develop profiles for entirely new types of Statements. The Quick Start Guide provides more information on these modes of use, and a decision tree to help adopters identify their best entry point into the VA Framework.

Modeling Foundations
####################

Variant Representation
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
To represent molecular variations that are subjects of VA Statements, the VA-Spec adopts two complementary GKS standards:

#. The `GA4GH Variant Representation Specification (VRS) <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/latest/index.html>`_, which provides JSON Schema for representing many classes of discrete genetic variation, and tools for generating globally-unique computed variant identifiers. VRS variants represent discrete instances of sequence variation in a specified context (reference, location, state) - e.g. the NM_005228.5(EGFR):c.2232_2250del(p.Lys745fs) variant `here <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/177787/>`_. This includes single continuous alleles, haplotypes, genotypes, and copy number changes.

#. The `GA4GH Categorical Variation Representation Specification (Cat-VRS) <https://github.com/ga4gh/cat-vrs?tab=readme-ov-file>`_, which is built on top of VRS and provides a terminology and data model for describing 'categorical' variation concepts. Categorical variations are intensionally defined sets of variations, based on criteria that must be met for inclusion in a given category. Examples include `BRAF V600 mutations <https://civicdb.org/molecular-profiles/17/summary>`_ and `EGFR exon 19 deletions <https://civicdb.org/molecular-profiles/133/summary>`_. 

VRS and Cat-VRS models are directly imported for use in VA schema, and the VA-Spec reference implementation will incorporate VRS tools for identifier generation, normalization, and validation. See linked documentation above for more information about these specifications.  

VA Statement Representation
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The **Core Information Model (Core-IM)** is a domain-agnostic model for representing statements of knowledge, and the foundation on which Statement-specific VA profiles are built. Below we provide an overview of the Core-IM **Class Hierarchy**, the **Statement Structures** these classes are used to construct, and features of the model that allow explicit representation of **Statement Semantics**. 

Core-IM Class Hierarchy
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
The initial version of the Core-IM was derived from the SEPIO Core Information Model, through selection of elements needed to support initial VA implementation use cases. A hierarchical view of this model is illustrated in **Figure 1**.

.. core-im-class-hierarchy:

.. figure:: images/core-im-class-hierarchy.PNG

**Legend** Figure 1: Hierarchical structure of classes and attributes comprising the domain-agnostic Core-IM. Note that a hierarchy of Domain Entity classes has been defined to represent things like Genes, Conditions, and Therapeutic Procedures, but is omitted here for space. See here for details. 

As VA implementations evolve and new VA profiles are created, more content from SEPIO will be added to support new requirements. The VA-Spec team has partnered with SEPIO developers to ensure coordinated evolution of these two standards.  For more information, see `"What is the SEPIO Framework?" <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-is-the-sepio-framework>`_, and `"How does the VA-Spec use SEPIO?"` <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-does-the-va-spec-use-the-sepio-framework>`_ FAQs.

Core-IM Statement Structure
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
The Core-IM supports Statement-centric approach, where each discrete assertion of knowledge is captured in a self-contained **Statement** object which roots a data structure like that in **Figure 2**. 


.. core-im-statement-data-structure:

.. figure:: images/core-im-statement-data-structure.PNG

**Legend** Figure 2: A class-level view of the 'associative' structure that VA Statements takes (as opposed to the 'hierarchical' structure of Core-IM class definitions that is depicted in **Figure 1**). Italicized text under class names illustrate the kind of information each class may report in the case of a Variant Pathogenicity Statement supported by Population Allele Frequency evidence.

In this structure, a Statement object roots a central axis, where it is linked to one or more **Evidence Lines** representing discrete arguments for or against it, and each Evidence Line may then be linked to one or more pieces of information used as evidence (i.e. **Evidence Items**) contributing to such an argument. Surrounding the axis are classes that describe the provenance of these core artifacts, including **Contributions** made to them by **Agents**, **Activities** performed in doing so, **Methods** that specify their creation, and **Documents** that describe them. This structure allows precise tracking of provenance information at the level of a Statement and each supporting Evidence Line and Item. A full data example illustrating the structure of a Variant Pathogenicity Statement can be found here (``TO DO``).

Core-IM Statement Semantics
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Every Statement object in the Core-IM puts forth a **Proposition** - a possible fact it assesses or reports to be true. The semantics of this Proposition are explicitly captured using ``subject``, ``predicate``, and ``object`` attributes, and optional ``qualifier`` slot(s) (**Figure 3**). Additional ``direction`` and ``strength`` attributes can report whether the Statement reports the Proposition to be true or false, and the strength of evidence supporting this claim. 

.. core-im-statement-semantics:

.. figure:: images/core-im-statement-semantics.PNG

**Legend** Figure 3: Explicit Statement Semantics are supported by the Core-IM. (a) Model: the Statement model for a Variant Pathogenicity Profile, showing only attributes used to represent the semantics of what a statement reports to be true. (b) Data: a json data example of a Variant Pathogenicity Statement instance, noting elements holding the Statement's proposition and those assessing it's strength and direction. (c) Semantics: the  plain-language meaning of what the statement data structure reports to be true. 

This basic model supports two "modes of use" for Statements: an 'Assertion Mode' which support simple assertions of knowledge, and a 'Proposition Assessment Mode' allowing nuanced representations of the state of evidence surrounding a possible fact. Implementations can choose the mode that best fits their data. Details are provided in the ``Statement`` class page `here <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core-information-model/entities/information-entities/statement.html#implementation-guidance>`_.

.. note::  **Study Result Profiles**: While the majority of applications are focused on creating **Statement** profiles, the modeling framework supports profiling of other Core-IM classes, including **Study Results** and **Evidence Lines**. For example, the `CohortAlleleFrequencyStudyResult <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standard-profiles/study-result-profiles.html#cohort-allele-frequency-study-result>`_ profile specializes the StudyResult class to represent select data from statistical analyses of allele frequencies in different human populations along with methodological and quality metadata.

Types of Profiles
#################
While the majority of applications of the VA-Spec deal in knowledge statements, and use **Statement** Profiles, the modeling framework supports  profiling of other Core-IM classes such as **Study Result**.  Study Results are used when the information captured represents data items a study or dataset pertaining to some variant of interest, as  opposed to a broader statement of knowledge (e.g, one that may be concluded from interpretation of such data).  

For example, the `CohortAlleleFrequencyStudyResult <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standard-profiles/study-result-profiles.html#cohort-allele-frequency-study-result>`_ profile specializes the StudyResult class to represent select data from statistical analyses of allele frequencies in different human populations along with methodological and quality metadata.  More information on the StudyResult class and how it can be profiled can be found `here <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core-information-model/entities/information-entities/study-result.html>`_  and `here <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/profiling-methodology.html>`_.







**Attic:**

The **GA4GH Variant Annotation Specification (VA-Spec)** was developed by a partnership among national information resource providers and major public initiatives â€” as an open specification to standardize the exchange of such variation knowledge. It leverages the GA4GH `VRS <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ and `Cat-VRS <https://github.com/ga4gh/cat-vrs?tab=readme-ov-file>`_ specifications to represent diverse kinds of molecular variation as annotation subjects (see `"What types of variants are supported?" <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-types-of-variants-are-supported>`_). It supports diverse kinds of biological and clinical variant knolwedge, leaving case-level variant inforamtion to other standards (see `"What types of variant knowledge are supported?" <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-kinds-of-variant-knowledge-are-supported>`_ ). 

The VA-Spec is built as a **SEPIO-based modeling framework** that supports implementation-driven development of standard models for specific VA Statement types (see `"What is SEPIO?" <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-is-the-sepio-framework>`_).  The framework is comprised of the following components:


The VA-Spec is built on the SEPIO Modeling Framework - leveraging this established methodology for defining provenance-focused standards, to define diverse VA Statement profiles as extensions of a Core Information Model (see `"What is the SEPIO Framework?" <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-is-the-sepio-framework>`_.

And it is built as an extension of the SEPIO Modeling Framework - leveraging this established model and profiling methodology for defining provenance-focused standards, to define diverse VA Statement profiles as extensions of a Core Information Model (see `"What is SEPIO?" <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-is-the-sepio-framework>`_.

The series of figures below provides a high-level overview of the processes through which VA models are generated, from the creation and evolution of the foundational Core-IM, to derivation of Statement profiles from the Core-IM, to the maturation of draft profiles into established standards, and the adoption and iterative refinement of these standards.

This basic model supports two "modes of use" for Statements, which allow for simple assertions of knowledge, or nuanced representations of the state of evidence surrounding a given Proposition. Implementations can choose the mode that best fits their data.

Cat-VRS tools will facilitate mapping of such categorical concepts onto sets of discrete variant instances in the real world. For example, `NM_005228.5(EGFR):c.2232_2250del(p.Lys745fs) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/177787/>`_ is a discrete variant that matches the "EGFR exon 19 deletions" categorical variant definition.

 Additional details about the models and methodologies involved are provided in referenced documents for further exploration.
