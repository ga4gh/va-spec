GA4GH Variant Annotation Specification
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The **Variant Annotation Specification (VA-Spec)** is a standard developed by the **Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)** to facilitate sharing of biological and clinical knowledge about molecular genetic variants. It provides a set of **Standard Models** for exchanging specific kinds of **Statements** and **Study Results** about **Molecular Variation**, and a **Modeling Framework** supporting community-driven development of these standards as **Profiles** of a foundational **Core Information Model**. 
	
Consult the pages on this site for information about the specification and how to use it. Readers may wish to view a `data example <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/variant-pathogenicity-statement.html>`_ before reviewing the documentation. 
 * `Introduction <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html>`_: An entry point for understanding the VA-Spec and how its components are developed, with links to more detailed content.
 * `Quick Start Guide <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start-guide.html>`_: Resources to help implementers begin working with the VA-Spec.
 * `Core Information Model <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core-information-model/index.html>`_: Detailed descriptions and implementation guidance for the classes and attributes in the foundational Core-IM.
 * `Standard Profiles <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standard-profiles/index.html>`_: Detailed descriptions and implementation guidance for Statement and Study Result Profiles provided as standards for representing variant knowledge. 
 * `Profiling Methodology <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/profiling-methodology.html>`_: Instructions and resources for creating or expanding Statement and Study Result Profiles through the SEPIO profiling process.
 * `Modeling Foundations <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modeling-foundations.html>`_: An overview of the modeling patterns and principles that underpin VA-Spec information models.
 * `Reference Implementation <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference-implementation.html>`_: Documentation about code libraries that facilitate implementation of the VA-Spec.
 * `Examples <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html>`_: A set of examples illustrating representation of data using VA Standard Profiles. 
 * `FAQ <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html>`_: Answers to commonly asked questions that provide deeper insight into specific aspects of the VA-Spec.
