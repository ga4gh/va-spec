Standard Profiles
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**VA Standard Profiles** define the structure and semantics of the Standard Models that will be used by the GA4GH community. 

They are built as **specializations of the Statement or Study Result classes** in the Core-IM, that supports a specific type of knowledge about molecular variation.  

Each Profile is authored as a yaml-based information model, from which web documentation and a formal json schema are automatically generated by GKS Metaschema Tooling. 

The editable **yaml source files** in which profile models are defined can be found `here <https://github.com/ga4gh/va-spec/tree/1.x/schema/profiles>`_. 

Derived machine-readable **JSON schema** for eacc Profile can be found `here <https://github.com/ga4gh/va-spec/tree/1.x/schema/profiles/json>`_.

Web **documentation** about each Standard Profile can be found in the pages linked below.
