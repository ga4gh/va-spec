Standard Profiles
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

``PREREQUISITES:`` :ref:`Introduction <introduction>`,  :ref:`Core Information Model <core-im>`

**VA Standard Profiles** are the end product of the VA Modeling Framework, providing standard models that will be used by the GA4GH community to store and exchange variant data. 

They are built as specializations of the :ref:`Statement<Statement>` or :ref:`Study Result<StudyResult>` classes in the Core-IM, that support a specific type of knowledge about genetic variation.  

**Statement Profiles** are used to represent discrete assertions of variant **knowledge** (e.g. a pathogenicity classification).  

**Study Result Profiles** are used to capture collections of **data items** about a single variant, from a particular study or analysis dataset (e.g. from the gnomAD cohort allele frequency dataset).

Each Profile is authored as a yaml-based information model, from which web documentation and a formal json schema are automatically generated by `GKS Metaschema Tooling <https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-metaschema>`_. 

The editable **yaml source files** in which profiles are defined can be found `here <https://github.com/ga4gh/va-spec/tree/1.x/schema/profiles>`_. 

Derived machine-readable **JSON schema** for each Profile can be found `here <https://github.com/ga4gh/va-spec/tree/1.x/schema/profiles/json>`_.

Web **documentation** about each Standard Profile can be found in the pages linked below.
