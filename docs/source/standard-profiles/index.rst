Standard Profiles
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

``PREREQUISITES:`` `Introduction <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html>`_,  `Core Information Model <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core-information-model/index.html>`_

**VA Standard Profiles** define the structure and semantics of the standard models that will be used by the GA4GH community to store and exchange variant data. 

They are built as **specializations of the Statement or Study Result classes** in the Core-IM, that support a specific type of knowledge about molecular variation.  

**Statement Profiles** used to represent discrete assertions of variant knowledge (e.g. a pathogenicity classification).  **Study Result Profiles** are used to capture collections of data about a single variant from a particular study or analysis dataset (e.g. from the gnomAD cohort allele frequency dataset).

Each Profile is authored as a yaml-based information model, from which web documentation and a formal json schema are automatically generated by `GKS Metaschema Tooling <https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-metaschema>`_. 

The editable **yaml source files** in which profiles are defined can be found `here <https://github.com/ga4gh/va-spec/tree/1.x/schema/profiles>`_. 

Derived machine-readable **JSON schema** for each Profile can be found `here <https://github.com/ga4gh/va-spec/tree/1.x/schema/profiles/json>`_.

Web **documentation** about each Standard Profile can be found in the pages linked below.
