Reference Implementation
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

``COMING SOON!``
  
Code libraries facilitate the use of the VA-Spec, but do not implement a
particular use or application.  Although there is only one library
currently planned, it is expected that others will eventually appear as
VA-Spec is adopted.

The **va-python** GA4GH VA-Spec Python Implementation will support all types covered by the
VA-Spec and the more foundational specifications on which it depends, including vrs,
cat-var, and the gks-core-im. 

The VA-Spec MAY be used without using this Python implementation.
