description: A phase III clinical trial (NCT00949650) found that median progression
  free survival among patients with exon 19 deletions or L858R EGFR mutations (n
  = 308) was 13.6 months for afatinib and 6.9 months for chemotherapy (HR, 0.47;
  95% CI, 0.34 to 0.65; P = 0.001).

  description: >-
    EGFR L858R has long been recognized as a functionally significant mutation in cancer,
    and is one of the most prevalent single mutations in lung cancer. Best described in
    non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first
    and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this
    mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as
    compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials
    that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in
    treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.

    label: EGFR
    description: "EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification
      and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its
      role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers
      has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
      have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib.
      Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly
      the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance
      marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some
      success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the
      EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung
      cancer. \nOverproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation
      of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and
      NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section)."
