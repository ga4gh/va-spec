description: 'The c.806_808delCCT (p.Ser269del) variant in KCNQ4 has been observed
  in at least 4 probands with hearing loss (PS4_Supporting; PMID: 23399560, 23443030,
  LMM unpublished data SCV000967428.1). This variant segregated with hearing loss
  in 12 additional individuals from 1 family (PP1_Strong; PMID: 23443030). The p.Ser269del
  variant was absent from large population studies (PM2; https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org).
  This variant causes a change in the length of the protein due to an in-frame deletion
  between the S5 membrane-spanning domain and the pore region, which is important
  for protein function (PM4). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified
  as likely pathogenic for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. ACMG/AMP
  Criteria applied as specified by the Hearing Loss Expert Panel: PP1_Strong, PM2,
  PM4, PS4_Supporting.'
