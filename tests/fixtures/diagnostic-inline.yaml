    BRAF V600E has been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. It is one of the
    most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor
    prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid
    cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in
    clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has
    also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in
    colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS
    mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib,
    vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating
    V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be
    ineffective without supplementary treatment.

  description: "BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of
    these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent.
    V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it,
    along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It
    is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the
    MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF
    mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types,
    although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary
    thyroid cancer. Oncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that
    determine their sensitivity to inhibitors. Class 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are
    RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer
    inhibitors. Class 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A,
    G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as
      constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be
      sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors. Class 3 BRAF mutations
      (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G,
      D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are
      RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS
      and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1
      in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC
      or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of
      receptor tyrosine kinase."
